# Personal Neovim Configuration

[![Nightly](https://github-drone.code-ape.dev/api/badges/TumbleOwlee/neovim-config/status.svg?ref=refs/tags/nightly)](https://github-drone.code-ape.dev/TumbleOwlee/neovim-config)

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration file. It was crated based on ideas collected from other users and provides an easy setup on a new machine. It's aim is to get my previous setup done in lua instead of vimscript.
