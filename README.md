This reposity contains my personal Neovim configuration. It is a collection of various plugins that I collected over the time. I'm keeping it up-to-date and will add or remove plugins anytime I find something useful or replace some plugin with a more modern version. 
The configuration provides an easy entrance into a basic setup for software developer's.
